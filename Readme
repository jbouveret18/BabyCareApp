BabyCare is a mobile app that plays the role of a French online health book. It allows the parents to follow their child's growth and health evolution 
from their birth all the way to their 16th birthday. In addition to this, parents will be able to follow the important dates (when to get a booster, 
when is the next doctor appointment, etc.), an interactive map in order to find the closest doctor with the information to contact them, a place to put 
the child's health documents and a large selection of articles related to childcare, health but also parenting and ways to counter parenting exhaustion.
